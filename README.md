### **Description**
This script helps to find the shortest path between any two actors
by choosing a sequence of movies that connects them. Initial state and goal state are defined by the two people weâ€™re trying to connect. By using breadth-first search algorithm, we can find the shortest path from one actor to another.

### **How to run**
1. Clone this repo.
2. Run `python3 degrees.py small` or `python3 degrees.py large`.
3. You can run script with small or large dataset.
